Last year, air pollution in Bogot√° cost the city more than four billion pesos and this same phenomenon was responsible for the loss of an estimated 3,900 lives in the capital.

The situation was not much different in several of the country's most populated cities.

The population density of these metropolises keep rising, and with it, the generation of solid waste, carbon emissions due to the abundant number of automobiles and the massive contamination of water sources.

For this and much more, Am√©city was born. A project that through a gamification system seeks to unite citizens to confront the environmental deterioration generated by the disorganized growth of the most populated cities in Colombia.

At Am√©city we reward environmentally responsible citizens. Consequently, the way it works is: You enter the application, choose one of the available challenges, upload the evidence and receive points that you can then redeem for discounts at gyms, restaurants, barbershops and more.

We achieve the above thanks to a network of allied companies that have a presence in these cities that are willing to contribute to improving the quality of life of citizens through an increasingly optimal environment.

In addition, we have a network of suppliers so that, regardless of the city where you are, you can have special discounts in companies that provide the inputs that help complete the challenges.

**At Am√©city we move for our city and unite for the planet.**
